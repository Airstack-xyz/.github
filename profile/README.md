# Airstack

**Enabling data aware web3 apps**

## Introduction

Airstack is developing Protocols and APIs for browsing, discovering, and consuming on-chain data across projects and across blockchains. Our motivation for creating Airstack is to enable common ways to organize blockchain data and make it universally consumable, ushering in a new generation of data aware apps and services.

To do so, Airstack is helping standardize blockchain data, aggregating it, mapping relationships, and providing protocols and APIs to access it.

[Here](https://app.airstack.xyz/) is a live example of how the Airstack entities are consumed.

Developers are encouraged to explore the [Airstack Subgraphs](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz/airstack-subgraph) to learn more about our schemas and how to publish subgraphs to Airstack. Our work on Substreams are also here in this Github.
