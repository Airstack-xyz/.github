# Airstack

**Airstack is a decentralized data network that enables easy querying across projects and blockchains. To make it possible we’re standardizing blockchain data, aggregating and mapping it, and providing protocols and APIs to consume it.**

[Here](https://app.airstack.xyz/) is a live example of how the Airstack entities are consumed.

## Introduction

Airstack is developing a Protocol and DAPP for browsing, discovering, and consuming on-chain data across projects and across blockchains. Our motivation for creating Airstack is to enable common ways to organize blockchain data and make it universally consumable.

This is a large and important problem to solve. On Ethereum based chains (EVMs) alone there are already more than 10 million daily transactions happening across thousands of protocols and dapps. Today those transactions exist in silos; there are no easy ways to query across projects and blockchains — to map relationship and behaviors, discover trends at the event level, and analyze product utility.

Airstack is building the tooling now to enable a decentralized web3 data network that will enable easy querying of data across projects and blockchains.

To do so, Airstack is helping standardize blockchain data, aggregating it, mapping relationships, and providing protocols and APIs to access it.

Developers are encouraged to explore the [Airstack Subgraphs](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz/airstack-subgraph) to learn more about our schemas and how to publish subgraphs to Airstack.
