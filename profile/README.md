**The easiest way to query and build with web3**

## Introduction

Airstack APIs make it easy to query and build with web3 data, helping power a new generation of interoperable data-aware web3 applications and protocols. 

Before Airstack web3 data was public but hard to query and integrate. Developers had to run a lot infrastracture that was non-core to their applications in order to get and integrate relevant on-chain data. 

Airstack enables developers to easily query across projects and chains and to get plug-and-play APIs, webhooks, and SDKs to make use of the data in their apps. 

Some key features we're currently working on at Airstack include:
- GraphQL: Get the exact data you need in easy to integrate formats
- SDKs and webhooks: for streaming updates
- No code query builder: Not comfortable with GraphQL? No worries. Our no-code query builder helps make web3 data accessible to everyone
- Complex queries made easy: With Airstack you can query across multiple projects, wallets, and blockchains
- Collaboration built in: Browse, remix, or fork from a public marketplace of queries and APIs

We utilize Substreams and Subgraphs for supplying on-chain data into Airstack. We augment on-chain data with off-chain metadata from IPFS and marketplaces (for example NFT images). Wherever possible we default to on-chain data. 

Airstack is launching in Q1 2023 for EVM based blockchains with an initial focus on digital collectibles, NFTs, games, social, music, and publishing.
