# Airstack

Web3 data APIs, for builders

Instantly integrate on-chain and off-chain data into any application. Airstack APIs make it easy to query and build with web3 data, helping power a new generation of interoperable data-aware web3 applications and protocols. 

Our integrated AI Assistant enables natural language entry, such as: "show me all tokens held by vitalik.eth and the images of his NFTs."

Our identity APIs uniquely enable you to query across a user's ENS, Farcaster, NFTs, and more.
